# valheim-server

## This is a personal repo for the use of the valheim server on a Mac computer.
Currently running this on a Mac mini with docker installed. (8GB RAM and 4 core i5)

This repository is mainly for version control of my server configuration as well as some fun scripts for starting the server (probably over-engineered) and updating the docker image when Valheim devs push updates (this script needs work but it's simple enough).
